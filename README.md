# WillXpert â€” Learning Project

This project was built as part of my learning journey in web development. I created and deployed a **responsive website for WillXpert**, a legal services firm, to practice real-world application of HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript.

## What I Learned
- Structuring a multi-section website (Home, About, Services, Contact)
- Building responsive layouts with **TailwindCSS**
- Implementing **SEO-friendly meta tags** and OpenGraph for social sharing
- Integrating forms for real-world use with **Formspree**

## Features
- Fully responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Contact form with WhatsApp and LinkedIn integration
- Simple, Modern and professional layout suitable for a legal practice
